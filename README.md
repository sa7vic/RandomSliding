# Photo Slider — Just a Fun Learning Project
Hey there!
This is a simple photo slider I built while messing around and picking up some new skills. Nothing fancy, just a cool little slider where you can swipe through images manually or let it slide automatically if you’re feeling lazy.

## What it does
Slide images by clicking arrows or swiping

Auto-slide images every few seconds

Smooth transitions to keep it looking slick


## Why I made it
Honestly? Just for fun and to learn some new tricks with JavaScript. It’s a neat little project to play with timers, event handling, and a bit of CSS magic.



## How to run it
Just open the index.html file in your browser and enjoy the show. No setup needed!


## What I learned
Handling user input for manual sliding

Using timers for automatic sliding

Styling transitions for smooth effects

Feel free to use it, tweak it, or break it — that’s how I learned!
